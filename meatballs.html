            <p>These are really good. I have made these several times. I usually make double and freeze them for a super quick weeknight dinner. I just throw them in the sauce pan on low to make sure they defrost all the way through and they are done before the spag. is cooked! I have also used this same recipe to make meatloaf. Super good, easy versatile recipe!<br><br>

            <p>Just took these out of the oven, they smell heavenly! I do think next time I make them I will season them up a little bit more before baking, with some Italian seasoning. They were very easy to make, I will definitely keep this recipe handy.<br><br>
