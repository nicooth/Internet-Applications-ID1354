            <p>Just made these exactly as written, thought they were very good. It's nice to find a recipe that doesn't call for butter milk, which I hardly ever have. I let the batter rest for about 10 minutes before using it. Anything with baking powder benefits from this. So after putting it together, and a few minutes more, then I heated my griddle up. It's a little bubbleing on top when ready.<br><br>Posted by: D Mascola January 3rd, 2017</p>

            <p>Super easy and delicious! I substituted almond milk and oat flour and it still turned out like the pictures. And serving with greek yogurt and berries is the perfect complement.<br><br>Posted by: Julia Pappas April 25th, 2017</p>
